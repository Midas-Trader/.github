# Welcome to the Midas Trading Systemüëã

The Midas Trading System is a comprehensive ecosystem designed for financial market analysis, backtesting trading strategies, and executing trades both in backtest environments and live markets. Our goal is to provide a seamless transition from strategy development to live trading with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency.

## Our Projects

### üìà midas-backend
- **Description**: A Django REST Framework (DRF) application that stores historical price data and backtest results. It's designed for flexibility, allowing storage and retrieval of vast amounts of financial data.
- **Deployment**: While we personally run it on Heroku utilizing the PostgreSQL add-on, the application is designed to be adaptable to various environments and database systems.
- **Repository**: [midas-backend](https://github.com/anthonyb8/midas-backend)

### üêç midas-python
- **Description**: A Python-based backtest and live trade engine. It is crafted to ensure that backtesting mirrors live trading scenarios as closely as possible, facilitating an effortless transition to live trading. Historical data is fetched from the `midas-backend` database, while live data integration is handled through IBAPI, aligning with our choice of brokerage.
- **Repository**: [midas-python](https://github.com/anthonyb8/midas-python)

### üíª midas-cpp
- **Description**: An emerging project aimed at replicating the functionality of `midas-python` in C++. The goal is to maintain similar system design principles, offering an alternative for those who prefer or require C++ for their trading strategies.
- **Repository**: [midas-cpp](https://github.com/anthonyb8/midas-cpp)

### üìä midas-dashboard
- **Description**: A React application designed for local or cloud deployment. Its main function is to fetch and display backtest results from `midas-backend`, providing an intuitive interface for strategy analysis and comparison.
- **Deployment**: The dashboard can be deployed locally or on platforms like Vercel for enhanced accessibility.
